# Nike Shoes Ad Generation Prompt

## Prompt for Video Generation

```
Create a dynamic and energetic advertisement for Nike Air Max running shoes. Show an athlete in motion - starting with a close-up of the shoes on a sleek urban track, then transitioning to a side-angle shot of the runner in full stride with the shoes prominently featured, followed by a slow-motion detail shot highlighting the Air Max cushioning technology, and finally ending with the runner crossing a finish line in victory. The ad should emphasize performance, style, and innovation. Use vibrant colors, dynamic camera movements, and showcase the iconic Nike swoosh and Air Max design elements throughout. The overall mood should be empowering, athletic, and modern.
