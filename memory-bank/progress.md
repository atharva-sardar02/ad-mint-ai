# Progress Log

## 2025-11-21
- ✅ Verified interactive pipeline WebSocket path end-to-end (frontend service → backend handler).
- ✅ Confirmed local storage fallback (in-memory) and absence of pipeline tables in SQLite.
- ✅ Created Memory Bank baseline documents to preserve project knowledge between sessions.
- ⏳ Pending: capture real `conversation_history` structure via logging and normalize it to stop the `unhashable type: 'slice'` error.
