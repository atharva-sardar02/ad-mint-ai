A luxurious Dior perfume bottle elegantly positioned on a glossy black surface, with the Eiffel Tower softly blurred in the background at twilight, captured in a close-up portrait using a Canon EOS R5 with an 85mm f/1.2 lens, illuminated by soft, diffused lighting that highlights the sleek contours of the bottle, featuring a cinematic color grading with warm, golden hues to evoke an upscale and romantic atmosphere, in a 16:9 aspect ratio.
