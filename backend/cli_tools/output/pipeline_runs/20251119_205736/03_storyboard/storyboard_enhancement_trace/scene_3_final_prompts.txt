FINAL PROMPTS FOR SCENE 3 (Desire):

START FRAME:
In the initial frame, the Dior CANUE perfume bottle, a rectangular transparent glass masterpiece with slightly rounded edges and a matte black cylindrical cap, is subtly positioned at the bottom left corner of the frame, illuminated by the dim, scattered light of Paris' twilight, creating a mysterious and subdued silhouette against the backdrop of softly glowing street lamps and the distant, elegantly lit Eiffel Tower.

END FRAME:
As the scene concludes, the same Dior CANUE bottle now takes center stage, dramatically relocated to the upper right corner of the frame, bathed in a radiant spotlight that highlights its sleek glass surfaces and the minimalist elegance of its label, with the Eiffel Tower now a blurred, romantic glow in the background, symbolizing the bottle's ascent to iconic status amidst Paris' enchanting night.

MOTION:
Throughout the scene, the camera executes a dynamic orbital rotation around the bottle, transitioning from a mysterious backlit silhouette to a vividly lit hero shot, while the background subtly shifts from detailed Parisian street scenes to a soft, dreamlike focus on the Eiffel Tower, enhancing the bottle's journey from the shadows into a captivating beam of light that seems to draw all of Paris into its allure.
