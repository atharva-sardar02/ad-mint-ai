START FRAME:
As twilight descends on Paris, the Dior CANUE bottle is subtly glimpsed through a veil of delicate, flowing silk curtains that flutter in the soft evening breeze, captured in a close-up side profile shot from the left, with the warm golden hues of the city faintly illuminating the scene from behind, the bottle positioned in the foreground on the left side of the frame, creating a mysterious and inviting atmosphere.

END FRAME:
The scene dramatically transitions to a wide shot from a high angle bird's eye view, with the Dior CANUE bottle now placed off-center in the background, as the camera moves to reveal a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower standing majestically against an amber sky, the bottle's sleek reflective glass now fully catching the deeper amber light of the setting sun, highlighting the minimalist label and the luxurious liquid within, symbolizing the timeless elegance and romance of Paris.

MOTION:
The camera performs a dramatic crane movement upwards and shifts from a close-up side profile to a wide high angle, transitioning the focus from the intimate details of the fluttering silk curtains and subtle glimpses of the bottle, through a parallax effect that gracefully reveals the Eiffel Tower in the background, while the evening light deepens to a rich amber, casting dynamic reflections on the bottle's glass surface and transforming the visual mood from mysterious allure to a clear, romantic connection.
