START FRAME:
As the twilight deepens over Paris, the camera captures a close-up of the Dior CANUE bottle, partially obscured by a flowing silk curtain, its sleek, reflective glass catching the fading golden light; the Eiffel Tower forms a blurred silhouette in the far background, hinting at the romantic Parisian setting.

END FRAME:
The scene transforms to reveal the Dior CANUE bottle now fully in focus, prominently positioned against a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower illuminated by vibrant amber lights; the curtain has swayed aside, allowing the bottle's minimalist label and the luxurious liquid within to gleam under a spotlight of warm, ambient lighting.

MOTION:
The camera executes a dramatic crane movement from a close-up side view that captures the subtle interplay of light on the bottle's glass surface, transitioning through a smooth arc to a 3/4 front-facing view as the silk curtain gracefully sways to unveil the Eiffel Tower, now sharply focused in the background, enhancing the emotional connection to the iconic Parisian landscape.
