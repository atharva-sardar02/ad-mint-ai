FINAL PROMPTS FOR SCENE 1 (Discovery):

START FRAME:
As twilight descends over Paris, the scene opens with a mysterious low angle worm's eye view from ground level, focusing on abstract shadows and warm golden hues that dance across the elegant silk curtains stirred by a soft breeze, hinting at the hidden presence of the Dior CANUE bottle, which remains obscured from view, creating a sense of anticipation and curiosity.

END FRAME:
Transitioning to a dramatically different high angle bird's eye view from above, the camera captures the Parisian skyline at dusk, where the distant silhouette of the Eiffel Tower emerges against the fading amber sky, and the bottle, now partially revealed, sits elegantly on a classic Parisian balcony railing, bathed in the soft glow of city lights, inviting closer inspection.

MOTION:
The camera ascends swiftly, transitioning from the intimate close-ups of rustling silk curtains to the grandeur of Paris at twilight, with the movement punctuated by the rustling of leaves and a distant echo of laughter, as the focus shifts subtly from the abstract play of shadows to the iconic Parisian backdrop, gradually uncovering the Dior CANUE bottle that reflects the city's enchanting ambiance.
