A bottle of luxury Dior perfume elegantly positioned against a backdrop of the iconic Paris skyline at twilight, captured through a Canon EOS R5 with an 85mm f/1.2 lens, featuring a close-up portrait with soft, diffused lighting that highlights the intricate details of the bottle, shallow depth of field blurring the Eiffel Tower gently in the background, and a cinematic color grading that enhances the romantic, sophisticated mood of the scene.
